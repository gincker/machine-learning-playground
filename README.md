# A Machine Learning Playground: Gincker AI


### What is Gincker AI?

Gincker AI, much like JSFiddle as a front-end code playground, is an interactive playground for machine learning (ML). It allows users to 
test ML algorithms and train ML models without writing any code, firing up IDE, installing libraries, or setting up a local server. This ML
playground has the following main features:

- prototype and test ML algorithms without code.
- Train ML models using your own data or math functions.
- Visualize ML results on screen in realtime.
- Save ML algorithms and results to a unique URL.
- Share your ML algorithms and results via URL.
- Collaborate with others on developing ML models.

### Machine Learning Models on Gincker AI

Currently, Gincker AI has implemented over 30 ML models, as shown in the following image. We'll add more machine learning models to our playground gradually.
